            <p>The evaluation team was charged with designing studies to assess AI common sense in three domains: <a href="/CommonsenseDomain/Objects">Objects</a>,
                <a href="/CommonsenseDomain/Agents">Agents</a>, and <a href="/CommonsenseDomain/Places">Places</a>. The evaluation team comprised experts in two domains: developmental psychologists with
                training in the assessment of infant and toddler perception, cognition, and behavior, and software engineers
                able to program virtual environments in which AI systems could be given tests based on what is known about
                infants' and toddlers' understandings of objects, agents, and places. </p>

            <p> The evaluation had three innovative features: it was motivated by research in developmental psychology, it
                involved novel hypercube designs, and training data can be generated by AI development teams using an
                interactive learning environment (ILE). </p>

                                            The tests were motivated by the research literature on early developing competencies, so they were analogous
                                            to tasks designed to assess competencies seen in infants and toddlers. Two broad classes of tests were
                                            developed: “passive” tasks and “interactive” tasks. Passive tasks were created to mimic looking-time tasks,
                                            a common assessment tool used with infants and young children. In looking-time tasks, the duration of
                                            looking at various scenes is recorded, and the child's competencies are inferred from variations in their
                                            duration of looking at the scenes; typically, infants look longer at unexpected events in such scenes. For
                                            example, many infants look longer at physically impossible events than at physically possible events. Newly
                                            designed analogous tests evaluating AI competence involved providing AI systems with scenes that appear
                                            plausible or implausible to human observers, and then asking the AI systems to generate plausibility scores
                                            at the end of the scenes. Interactive tasks were created to mimic experimental assessments in which young
                                            children are required to retrieve an object (e.g., a toy hidden in a container). Newly designed analogous
                                            tests evaluating AI competence involved situating AI systems in a virtual room containing a reward object.
                                            The AI's goal was to retrieve the reward by moving around the room and interacting with everyday objects and
                                            agents. Both the interactive tasks and the passive tasks have a recent history in the AI evaluation field-

                                            The evaluations used hypercube designs that controlled for numerous variables while manipulating a single
                                            variable at a time. Specifically, rather than presenting AI systems with a collection of scenes and
                                            reporting the overall proportion correct, the evaluations presented carefully controlled stimuli that
                                            permitted evaluation of the effects of specific variables on the AI's common sense reasoning. The hypercubes
                                            were inspired by experimental designs commonly used in psychological investigations and provide insight
                                            beyond whether or not an AI succeeds at a task. By systematically examining the effect of different
                                            variables on AI performance, these designs yield conclusions about how the AI solved the problem in some
                                            cases, or why the AI failed to solve the problem in other cases.

                                            No pre-generated training data were provided for most of the tasks. Instead, training data can be produced
                                            using the so-called Interactive Learning Environment (ILE) created by the engineers on the evaluation team.
                                            The ILE is a scene generator that creates scenes containing objects, agents, and mechanisms that look and
                                            behave like those encountered in the test scenes. As a result, developers can provide their AI systems with
                                            custom training data that allow for optimal training experience.
