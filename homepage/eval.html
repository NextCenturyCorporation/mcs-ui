                <h2>Instructions </h2>

                <p>The instructions here are for people viewing and evaluating the output
                of TA1 performers.  The goal is to gain some sort of insight into what
                the algorithms are doing, what information they are using, and where
                they fail.

                <p>Important points:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Ground Truth is either 1, meaning that it is 'Plausible' or
                            realistic, or 0, meaning that it is 'Implausible' or impossible.</li>

                        <li>The Score is based on <b>Loss</b>.  Lower is better.

                    </ul>

                <h3>Summary Stats</h3>

                <p>The link below will take you to a dashboard that will allow you to
                filter and select individual tests from the blocks.</p>
                
                <p><a href="http://ec2-54-157-23-98.compute-1.amazonaws.com:4199/?dashboard=-#%E2%9F%A6%E2%9F%A7">Overall Stats Page</a>

                <p><b>Bar Charts:</b> Click on any of the bar graphs to filter a
                particular sub-set of the test data.  For example, to only see results
                from Block O1, click on that bar in the Blocks area on the upper right.
                When you select a particular performer, submission, or block, the Ground
                Truth vs Plausibility graph will change, showing only that data.</p>

                <p>The tests in IntPhys are internally divided into different
                categories, depending on their level of dynamic complexity, the number
                of objects, and whether there is an occluder present.  You can also
                filter on these; for example, you can compare the results when there
                are different numbers of objects present.

                <p><b>Graph:</b> The Ground Truth vs Plausibility graph in the middle
                shows the ground truth (either 0 for implausible or 1 for plausible)
                versus the submitted answer (a float value between 0 and 1).  A perfect
                score would be to have all the results at the bottom left (0,0) or upper
                right (1,1).  The graph is also selectable; click-and-drag around a set
                of results.

                <p><b>Data Table and Links:</b> The data table on the bottom of the page
                will allow a user to select in individual test.  Click on the link at
                the end of the row and it will take you to another page that shows the
                    results for that test.</p>

                <p><b>Score:</b>The score on the right is the average of the mean
                squared error (MSE) loss between ground truth (O or 1) and the
                plausibility score (floating point number between 0 and 1).  The MSE is
                also known as
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier Score</a>.
                Lower is better.

                <H3>Individual Test Results</h3>

                <p>After clicking on a link from the summary stats page data table, you
                will see the results from a single test.  The test consists of 4 scenes,
                each with 100 frames.

                <p>Please wait until the images are loaded.  After loading, there is a
                    slider that allows you to view the frames like a movie.

                <p>The plots at the bottom shows the Plausibility score for each scene
                as a function of frame number.  When the plausibility drops, it means
                that the algorithm discovered something that it thought was unrealistic.
